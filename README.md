# LinearRegressionFromScratch

This is an implementation of chosen Linear Regression algorithms, build as a C++ library.

:exclamation: NOTE: This project was created strictly for educational purposes â€” to explore how linear regression works under the hood, without relying on external machine learning libraries. Therefore it is not intended for production use and I cannot guarantee that it will perform optimally or handle every possible edge case. :exclamation:
