# LinearRegressionFromScratch

This is an implementation of chosen Linear Regression algorithms, build as a C++ library.

:exclamation: NOTE: This project was created strictly for educational purposes â€” to explore how linear regression works under the hood, without relying on external machine learning libraries. Therefore it is not intended for production use and I cannot guarantee that it will perform optimally or handle every possible edge case. :exclamation:

## What is it

**LinearRegressionFromScratch** is a library written in `C++ 17`. It implements two basic Linear Regression algorithms - *Normal Equation and Batch Gradient Descent.* Library might be built int. Despite the fact that the library is written in `C++` language, it might be also used with `python >= 3.11`. For installation guide, visit [How to run](#howtorun) section. For mathematical object representation, library is using [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/). This project also delivers features such as RMSE calculation for testing and evaluating trained model and K-fold cross validation.

## How to run
Full installation guide, alongside with installation scripts and library usage examples, are available in [install](./install/) directory.
